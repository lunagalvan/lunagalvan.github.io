# Favorite CPSC 120 L Labs

* Lab 1

    My favorite lab this semester was our very first lab, lab 1. I really enjoyed this lab because it was the very first program that I created. It was interesting to see how coding works.

* Lab 10, part 1

    My second favorite lab was lab 10, part 1. This lab was a lot of fun because we learned how to open and read text files. I also liked the concept of creating header files because it helps to keep things organized. 

* Lab 9, part 1

    Lab 9, part 1 was also fun for me because we learned how write functions that compute the average mean of all the elements of a vector. We also learned how to use if statements and used them to get the minimum and maximum elements.
